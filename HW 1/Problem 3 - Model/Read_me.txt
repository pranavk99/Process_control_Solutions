# Sample Yeast Batch Fermenter Model

*_This model is developed by Pranav Krishna, and is adapted from (Nagy 2007)_*

To run this simulation, open the files in MATLAB.
Make sure you are in the correct folder path. 
First run the parameters file. Ignore the warnings. These warnings show up because all the files are interlinked.
Then run the initialization files, and similarly, ignore the warnings. 
Then run the Reactor_run_file. This will call the model and plot the graphs. 

If there are errors in the last step, run the Bioreactor_modelnew file and repeat the last step again.
